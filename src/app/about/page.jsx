                        <p>A place to laugh, breathe, and break free from the chaos of work and burnout.
                            What started as one person looking for connection became a movement of techies, creatives, 
                            and builders craving something deeper: a human space in tech. We didn&#39;t want just another curated, 
                            cold community, we wanted something warm. Real. Imperfect. A village where people could grow, rest, pivot, 
                            laugh, mess up and still belong.
                        </p>

                        <p>THR!BE exists because we were never meant to do this alone. We&#39;re building the space we wish we 
                            had and leaving the door wide open for the next person. Not just to joinâ€¦ but to thrive.
